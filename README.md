# Object-oriented-Programming

## IN1910 — Programming for Scientific Applications

This repository contains my work from the IN1910 course at the University of Oslo (UiO), focused on object-oriented programming (OOP) and scientific computing in Python.
The course combines programming concepts, mathematical modeling, and numerical methods used in natural sciences.

## Course Overview

Course name: Programming for Scientific Applications
Code: IN1910
Institution: University of Oslo (UiO)
Focus areas:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python
- Scientific problem-solving through programming
- Code structure, testing, and documentation
- Numerical computation and visualization
- Simulation and data analysis

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, I can:

- Design modular and reusable Python programs using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation
- Implement numerical algorithms for solving physical and mathematical problems
- Apply NumPy, Matplotlib, and object-oriented design patterns in scientific code
- Write maintainable and well-documented code for research and engineering contexts
- Integrate simulation results with analytical and visual components

## Project Folder

### Projects/

This folder contains the three major course projects that demonstrate the practical application of programming in scientific contexts.

Each project includes a detailed report, source code, and results illustrating both theoretical understanding and practical programming skills.

#### Technologies and Tools

- Language: Python 3
- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy
- Testing: pytest
- Version control: Git + GitHub

#### Example Topics Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes, methods, attributes, and inheritance
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Numerical differentiation and integration
- Simulation of physical systems
- Random processes and Monte Carlo methods
- Visualization and scientific plotting

## Project Histories

### Projects (with full original history)

## 🧩 Projects (with full commit history)

Each project below was originally developed as part of the IN1910 — Object-Oriented Programming for Scientific Applications course at the University of Oslo.
The full development history (commits, merges, authorship, and evolution) has been preserved using git filter-repo.

All projects are preserved with complete Git history from the original UiO repositories.
