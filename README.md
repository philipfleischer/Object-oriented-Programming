# Object-oriented-Programming

## IN1910 — Programming for Scientific Applications

This repository contains my work from the IN1910 course at the University of Oslo (UiO), focused on object-oriented programming (OOP) and scientific computing in Python.
The course combines programming concepts, mathematical modeling, and numerical methods used in natural sciences.

## Course Overview

Course name: Programming for Scientific Applications
Code: IN1910
Institution: University of Oslo (UiO)
Focus areas:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python
- Scientific problem-solving through programming
- Code structure, testing, and documentation
- Numerical computation and visualization
- Simulation and data analysis

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, I can:

- Design modular and reusable Python programs using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation
- Implement numerical algorithms for solving physical and mathematical problems
- Apply NumPy, Matplotlib, and object-oriented design patterns in scientific code
- Write maintainable and well-documented code for research and engineering contexts
- Integrate simulation results with analytical and visual components

## Project Folder
