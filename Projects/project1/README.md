Exercise 2h Question:
How does the energy compared to the energy that you plotted in Exercise 2d?

Answer:
    - The energy in the undamped 2d is nearly conserved for the whole duration, but in the dampened 2h solution it looks like it gets halved for each time point, that leads me to believe it is decreasing in exponential time.


## Notes on Documentation
For improved clarity, I used ChatGPT to help generate docstrings at the start of the code files. I reviewed and edited the text and formulaes so that it would be correct according to the assignment text. 
I used this assistance mainly to bridge the gap between the heavy mathematical notation and terminology, since I found it challenging to explain these aspects of on my own.
